    "# 03. Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've covered the basics of TensorFlow and built a handful of models to work across different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to get specific and see how a special kind of neural network, [convolutional neural networks (CNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) can be used for computer vision (detecting patterns in visual data).\n",
    "\n",
    "> üîë **Note:** In deep learning, many different kinds of model architectures can be used for different problems. For example, you could use a convolutional neural network for making predictions on image data and/or text data. However, in practice some architectures typically work better than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to:\n",
    "* Classify whether a picture of food contains pizza üçï or steak ü•© (we're going to do this)\n",
    "* Detect whether or not an object appears in an image (e.g. did a specific car pass through a security camera?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to follow the TensorFlow modelling workflow we've been following so far whilst learning about how to build and use CNNs.\n",
