    "_A handful of example natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) problems. These are also often referred to as sequence problems (going from one sequence to another)._\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of [natural language processing (NLP)](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32) is to derive information from natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language is a broad term but you can consider it to cover any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text (such as that contained in an email, blog post, book, Tweet)\n",
    "- Speech (a conversation you have with a doctor, voice commands you give to a smart speaker)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the umbrellas of text and speech there are many different things you might want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're building an email application, you might want to scan incoming emails to see if they're spam or not spam (classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to analyse customer feedback complaints, you might want to discover which section of your business they're for.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔑 **Note:** Both of these types of data are often referred to as _sequences_ (a sentence is a sequence of words). So a common term you'll come across in NLP problems is called _seq2seq_, in other words, finding information in one sequence to produce another sequence (e.g. converting a speech command to a sequence of text-based steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get hands-on with NLP in TensorFlow, we're going to practice the steps we've used previously but this time with text data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text -> turn into numbers -> build a model -> train the model to find patterns -> use patterns (make predictions)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📖 **Resource:** For a great overview of NLP and the different problems within it, read the article [_A Simple Introduction to Natural Language Processing_](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32).\n",

    "  - Building several deep learning text models\n",
    "    - Dense, LSTM, GRU, Conv1D, Transfer learning\n",
    "- Comparing the performance of each our models\n",
    "- Combining our models into an ensemble\n",

    "Wonderful! We've got a training set and a validation set containing Tweets and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our labels are in numerical form (`0` and `1`) but our Tweets are in string form.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🤔 **Question:** What do you think we have to do before we can use a machine learning algorithm with our text data?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you answered something along the lines of \"turn it into numbers\", you're correct. A machine learning algorithm requires its inputs to be in numerical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, there are two main concepts for turning text into numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization** - A straight mapping from word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n",
    "  1. Using **word-level tokenization** with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being `0`, \"love\" being `1` and \"TensorFlow\" being `2`. In this case, every word in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n",
    "  2. **Character-level tokenization**, such as converting the letters A-Z to values `1-26`. In this case, every character in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n",
    "  3. **Sub-word tokenization** is in between word-level and character-level tokenization. It involves breaking invidual words into smaller parts and then converting those smaller parts into numbers. For example, \"my favourite food is pineapple pizza\" might become \"my, fav, avour, rite, fo, oo, od, is, pin, ine, app, le, piz, za\". After doing this, these sub-words would then be mapped to a numerical value. In this case, every word could be considered multiple **tokens**.\n",
    "- **Embeddings** - An embedding is a representation of natural language which can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a **feature vector**. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector `[-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]`. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings:\n",
    "  1. **Create your own embedding** - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as [`tf.keras.layers.Embedding`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding)) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n",
    "  2. **Reuse a pre-learned embedding** - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpuses of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a pre-trained embedding to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your own specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/08-tokenization-vs-embedding.png)\n",
    "_Example of **tokenization** (straight mapping from word to number) and **embedding** (richer representation of relationships between tokens)._\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🤔 **Question:** What level of tokenzation should I use? What embedding should should I choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on your problem. You could try character-level tokenization/embeddings and word-level tokenization/embeddings and see which perform best. You might even want to try stacking them (e.g. combining the outputs of your embedding layers using [`tf.keras.layers.concatenate`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/concatenate)).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking for pre-trained word embeddings, [Word2vec embeddings](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/), [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and many of the options available on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-embedding) are great places to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔑 **Note:** Much like searching for a pre-trained computer vision model, you can search for pre-trained word embeddings to use for your problem. Try searching for something like \"use pre-trained word embeddings in TensorFlow\".\n"

    "### Model 0: Getting a baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all machine learning modelling experiments, it's important to create a baseline model so you've got a benchmark for future experiments to build upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create our baseline, we'll create a Scikit-Learn Pipeline using the TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) formula to convert our words to numbers and then model them with the [Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html#sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB). This was chosen via referring to the [Scikit-Learn machine learning map](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📖 **Reading:** The ins and outs of TF-IDF algorithm is beyond the scope of this notebook, however, the curious reader is encouraged to check out the [Scikit-Learn documentation for more](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#tfidf-term-weighting)."

    "## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our next series of modelling experiments we're going to be using a special kind of neural network called a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The premise of an RNN is simple: use information from the past to help you with the future (this is where the term recurrent comes from). In other words, take an input (`X`) and compute an output (`y`) based on all previous inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is especially helpful when dealing with sequences such as passages of natural language text (such as our Tweets).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you read this sentence, you take into context the previous words when deciphering the meaning of the current word dog. \n",
    "\n",
    "See what happened there? \n",
    "\n",
    "I put the word \"dog\" at the end which is a valid word but it doesn't make sense in the context of the rest of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an RNN looks at a sequence of text (already in numerical form), the patterns it learns are continually updated based on the order of the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple example, take two sentences:\n",
    "1. Massive earthquake last week, no?\n",
    "2. No massive earthquake last week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both contain exactly the same words but have different meaning. The order of the words determines the meaning (one could argue punctuation marks also dictate the meaning but for simplicity sake, let's stay focused on the words).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks can be used for a number of sequence-based problems:\n",
    "* **One to one:** one input, one output, such as image classification.\n",
    "* **One to many:** one input, many outputs, such as image captioning (image input, a sequence of text as caption output).\n",
    "* **Many to one:** many inputs, one outputs, such as text classification (classifying a Tweet as real diaster or not real diaster).\n",
    "* **Many to many:** many inputs, many outputs, such as machine translation (translating English to Spanish) or speech to text (audio wave as input, text as output).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you come across RNN's in the wild, you'll most likely come across variants of the following:\n",
    "* Long short-term memory cells (LSTMs).\n",
    "* Gated recurrent units (GRUs).\n",
    "* Bidirectional RNN's (passes forward and backward along a sequence, left to right and right to left).\n",
    "\n",
    "Going into the details of each these is beyond the scope of this notebook (we're going to focus on using them instead), the main thing you should know for now is that they've proven very effective at modelling sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper understanding of what's happening behind the scenes of the code we're about to write, I'd recommend the following resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📖 **Resources:**\n",
    "> * [MIT Deep Learning Lecture on Recurrent Neural Networks](https://youtu.be/SEnXr6v2ifU) - explains the background of recurrent neural networks and introduces LSTMs.\n",
    "> * [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) by Andrej Karpathy - demonstrates the power of RNN's with examples generating various sequences.\n",
    "> * [Understanding LSTMs](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) by Chris Olah - an in-depth (and technical) look at the mechanics of the LSTM cell, possibly the most popular RNN building block.\n"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference will be that we're going to add an LSTM layer between our embedding and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to make sure we're not getting reusing trained embeddings (this would involve data leakage between models, leading to an uneven comparison later on), we'll create another embedding layer (`model_2_embedding`) for our model. The `text_vectorizer` layer can be reused since it doesn't get updated during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔑 **Note:** The reason we use a new embedding layer for each model is since the embedding layer is a *learned* representation of words (as numbers), if we were to use the same embedding layer (`embedding_1`) for each model, we'd be mixing what one model learned with the next. And because we want to compare our models later on, starting them with their own embedding layer each time is a better idea."
