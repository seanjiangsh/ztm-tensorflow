    "*A handful of example natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) problems. These are also often referred to as sequence problems (going from one sequence to another).*\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of [natural language processing (NLP)](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32) is to derive information from natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language is a broad term but you can consider it to cover any of the following:\n",
    "* Text (such as that contained in an email, blog post, book, Tweet)\n",
    "* Speech (a conversation you have with a doctor, voice commands you give to a smart speaker)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the umbrellas of text and speech there are many different things you might want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're building an email application, you might want to scan incoming emails to see if they're spam or not spam (classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to analyse customer feedback complaints, you might want to discover which section of your business they're for.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔑 **Note:** Both of these types of data are often referred to as *sequences* (a sentence is a sequence of words). So a common term you'll come across in NLP problems is called *seq2seq*, in other words, finding information in one sequence to produce another sequence (e.g. converting a speech command to a sequence of text-based steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get hands-on with NLP in TensorFlow, we're going to practice the steps we've used previously but this time with text data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text -> turn into numbers -> build a model -> train the model to find patterns -> use patterns (make predictions)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📖 **Resource:** For a great overview of NLP and the different problems within it, read the article [*A Simple Introduction to Natural Language Processing*](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32).\n",
