    "In the previous notebook ([transfer learning part 3: scaling up](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/06_transfer_learning_in_tensorflow_part_3_scaling_up.ipynb)) we built Food Vision mini: a transfer learning model which beat the original results of the [Food101 paper](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/) with only 10% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you might be wondering, what would happen if we used all the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that's what we're going to find out in this notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be building Food Vision Big‚Ñ¢, using all of the data from the Food101 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yep. All 75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images.\n",
    "\n",
    "And guess what...\n",
    "\n",
    "This time **we've got the goal of beating [DeepFood](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304163308_DeepFood_Deep_Learning-Based_Food_Image_Recognition_for_Computer-Aided_Dietary_Assessment)**, a 2016 paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üîë **Note:** **Top-1 accuracy** means \"accuracy for the top softmax activation value output by the model\" (because softmax ouputs a value for every class, but top-1 means only the highest one is evaluated). **Top-5 accuracy** means \"accuracy for the top 5 softmax activation values output by the model\", in other words, did the true label appear in the top 5 activation values? Top-5 accuracy scores are usually noticeably higher than top-1.\n",
