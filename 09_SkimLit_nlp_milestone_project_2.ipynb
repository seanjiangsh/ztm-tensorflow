    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook ([NLP fundamentals in TensorFlow](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/08_introduction_to_nlp_in_tensorflow.ipynb)), we went through some fundamental natural lanuage processing concepts. The main ones being **tokenzation** (turning words into numbers) and **creating embeddings** (creating a numerical representation of words).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we're going to be putting what we've learned into practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specificially, we're going to be replicating the deep learning model behind the 2017 paper [*PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequenctial Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071).\n",
    "\n",
    "When it was released, the paper presented a new dataset called PubMed 200k RCT which consists of ~200,000 labelled Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) abstracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the dataset was to explore the ability for NLP models to classify sentences which appear in sequential order.\n",
