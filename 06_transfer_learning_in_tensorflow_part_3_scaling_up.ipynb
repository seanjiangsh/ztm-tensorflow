    "\n",
    "Now we know our smaller modelling experiments are working, it's time to step things up a notch with more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning: get a model working on a small amount of data before scaling it up to a larger amount of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's time to get closer to our Food Vision project coming to life. In this notebook we're going to scale up from using 10 classes of the Food101 data to using all of the classes in the Food101 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to **beat the original [Food101 paper](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/static/bossard_eccv14_food-101.pdf)'s results with 10% of data**.\n",

    "- Saving and loaded our trained model\n",
    "- Evaluating the performance of our Food Vision model trained on 10% of the training data\n",
