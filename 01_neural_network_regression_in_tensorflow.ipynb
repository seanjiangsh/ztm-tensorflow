    "# 01. Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many definitions for a [regression problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) but in our case, we're going to simplify it to be: predicting a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to:\n",
    "- Predict the selling price of houses given information about them (such as number of rooms, size, number of bathrooms).\n",
    "- Predict the coordinates of a bounding box of an item in an image.\n",
    "- Predict the cost of medical insurance for an individual given their demographics (age, sex, gender, race).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to set the foundations for how you can take a sample of inputs (this is your data), build a neural network to discover patterns in those inputs and then make a prediction (in the form of a number) based on those inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're going to cover\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're going to go through doing the following with TensorFlow:\n",
    "- Architecture of a regression model\n",
    "- Input shapes and output shapes\n",
    "  - `X`: features/data (inputs)\n",
    "  - `y`: labels (outputs)\n",
    "- Creating custom data to view and fit\n",
    "- Steps in modelling\n",
    "  - Creating a model\n",
    "  - Compiling a model\n",
    "    - Defining a loss function\n",
    "    - Setting up an optimizer\n",
    "    - Creating evaluation metrics\n",
    "  - Fitting a model (getting it to find patterns in our data)\n",
    "- Evaluating a model\n",
    "  - Visualizng the model (\"visualize, visualize, visualize\")\n",
    "  - Looking at training curves\n",
    "  - Compare predictions to ground truth (using our evaluation metrics)\n",
    "- Saving a model (so we can use it later)\n",
    "- Loading a model\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if none of these make sense now, we're going to go through each.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How you can use this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read through the descriptions and the code (it should all run), but there's a better option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write all of the code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. I'm serious. Create a new notebook, and rewrite each line by yourself. Investigate it, see if you can break it, why does it break?\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to write the text descriptions but writing the code yourself is a great way to get hands-on experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you make mistakes, we all do. The way to get better and make less mistakes is to **write more code**."

    "## Typical architecture of a regresison neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "The word *typical* is on purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are many different ways (actually, there's almost an infinite number of ways) to write neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the following is a generic setup for ingesting a collection of numbers, finding patterns in them and then outputting some kind of target number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the previous sentence is vague but we'll see this in action shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Hyperparameter** | **Typical value** |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Input layer shape | Same shape as number of features (e.g. 3 for # bedrooms, # bathrooms, # car spaces in housing price prediction) |\n",
    "| Hidden layer(s) | Problem specific, minimum = 1, maximum = unlimited |\n",
    "| Neurons per hidden layer | Problem specific, generally 10 to 100 |\n",
    "| Output layer shape | Same shape as desired prediction shape (e.g. 1 for house price) |\n",
    "| Hidden activation | Usually [ReLU](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/rectified-linear-units-relu-in-deep-learning) (rectified linear unit) |\n",
    "| Output activation | None, ReLU, logistic/tanh |\n",
    "| Loss function | [MSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) (mean square error) or [MAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error) (mean absolute error)/Huber (combination of MAE/MSE) if outliers |\n",
    "| Optimizer | [SGD](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/SGD) (stochastic gradient descent), [Adam](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam) |\n",

    "\n",
    "Again, if you're new to neural networks and deep learning in general, much of the above table won't make sense. But don't worry, we'll be getting hands-on with all of it soon.\n",

    "> ðŸ”‘ **Note:** A **hyperparameter** in machine learning is something a data analyst or developer can set themselves, where as a **parameter** usually describes something a model learns on its own (a value not explicitly set by an analyst).\n",

    "Okay, enough talk, let's get started writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use TensorFlow, we'll import it as the common alias `tf` (short for TensorFlow)."
